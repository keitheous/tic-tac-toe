# tic-tac-toe

Yes, so I'm currently in my third week of WDI6 (Web Development Immersive is a 12 weeks intensive web design program that runs from 9am till 5pm ish MON to FRI) with General Assembly in Melbourne, Australia. For the past couple of weeks, 21 other students and myself were taught front end related topics such as JavaScript, CSS(i dont like CSS), HTML and DOM API. We're doing Ruby in Week 4, so perhaps we will be exposed to the back end stuff pretty soon.

Anyway, being in our third week, we were all required to complete an individual assignment - to create a TIC TAC TOE game - you know, that game you play when you're a kid. You draw a 3x3 grid on a piece of paper and you share a pencil with your friend and you either draw 'O's or 'X's. Whoever is first to create a straight line of their own symbol without being intercepted wins. Yes, big time.

At first I was really hopeless. I didnt think it was even possible. But eventually piece by piece, chunks by chunks, it all came together and formed this noobish game I've created and stored in my gitHub account. Eventually I hope my skills would improve over time and I will come back to implement other 'COOL' stuff like what some of my other advance classmates has implemented into their own TIC TAC TOE(such as unbeatable AI, really cool Pokemon CSS/Symbols and some of the other bonus stuff such as LOCAL STOREAGE - WONT FORGET YOU EVEN WHEN YOU CLOSE THE BROWSER hardcore stuff).

The page looks alright. It hits all the basic requirements, it's okay, not great. I struggled alot of CSS. especially with all the pre-existing MARGINS and PADDINGS in html tags, box models, and etc. I would like to thank all our instructors, namely, Daniel Tsui (D.T), David Bindloss and Hugh Middleton. Thank you very much guys, from the bottom of my heart. I hope you dont find me annoying with my stupid questions. If you are, I'm sad to say that you'll be seeing alot more of me in the coming weeks. Not Hugh though, he was a featured guest star.

Anyway, check it out. If you find a bug, please keep it to yourself so my instructors dont find out about it (or send me a msg, please send me a msg i was just kidding about the first part lol). See you later~
